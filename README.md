# 🐮 Zero-Knowledge Supply Chain for Ethical Animal Farming

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution that ensures transparency and ethics in animal farming without compromising sensitive business data! This project uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) on the Stacks blockchain with Clarity smart contracts to track the supply chain of animal products, verifying ethical practices like humane treatment, sustainable feed, and fair labor—while keeping proprietary details private.

## ✨ Features
🔒 Zero-knowledge proofs for verifying ethical compliance without revealing full data  
🐄 Track animals from farm to table with immutable records  
📊 Certify products as "ethically sourced" via blockchain badges  
✅ Consumer verification of product ethics via QR codes or NFTs  
🚫 Prevent fraud with tamper-proof audits and duplicate checks  
🌱 Support for multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, retailers, and auditors  
💰 Incentive tokens for compliant participants  

## 🛠 How It Works
This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a secure, privacy-preserving supply chain. Here's a high-level overview:

### Core Smart Contracts
1. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Registers farmers with their ethical certifications (e.g., organic feed standards). Stores hashed proofs of compliance.  
2. **AnimalTracking.clar**: Tracks individual animals or batches with lifecycle events (birth, feeding, health checks) using ZKP-verified data.  
3. **ZKProofVerifier.clar**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs submitted by participants to confirm ethical practices without exposing raw data.  
4. **SupplyChainStep.clar**: Logs each supply chain stage (e.g., farming, transport, processing) with timestamps and ZKP attestations.  
5. **ProductCertification.clar**: Issues digital certificates (as NFTs) for final products, linking back to verified chain data.  
6. **AuditTrail.clar**: Enables third-party auditors to submit ZKP-based reviews and flag non-compliance immutably.  
7. **ConsumerQuery.clar**: Allows end-users to query product ethics via a product ID, returning verified status without full chain details.  
8. **GovernanceToken.clar**: Manages a DAO-like token for voting on ethical standards updates and rewarding compliant farmers.

**For Farmers**  
- Register via FarmerRegistry with your details and submit a ZKP for initial compliance (e.g., proving cage-free conditions).  
- Use AnimalTracking to log events like vaccinations—generate a ZKP hash and call add-event.  
- At harvest, invoke SupplyChainStep to advance the batch with proof of humane practices.  

**For Processors/Retailers**  
- Receive batches and add steps via SupplyChainStep, attaching ZKPs for transport ethics.  
- Call ProductCertification to mint an NFT certificate once the chain is complete.  

**For Auditors**  
- Use AuditTrail to review aggregated proofs and submit verification reports.  
- Leverage ZKProofVerifier to validate submissions without accessing sensitive info.  

**For Consumers**  
- Scan a product QR code linked to the NFT in ProductCertification.  
- Query via ConsumerQuery to get a simple "Ethical: Yes/No" with proof links—zero details exposed!  

This setup solves real-world issues like consumer distrust in food labels and supply chain opacity, promoting ethical farming while protecting trade secrets. Deploy on Stacks for low-cost, Bitcoin-secured transactions. Start by cloning the repo and deploying the contracts in sequence!
